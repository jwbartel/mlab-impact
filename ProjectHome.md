The effects of network properties may have long reaching implications beyond effective file and data transfer. Â With the use of the Internet and networked systems in domains such as commerce and social communication, inefficiencies or variations in connections can correspond to major differences in these outside domains. The goal of this project is to unite these network properties with outside domains to better understand the effects they have on each other.
